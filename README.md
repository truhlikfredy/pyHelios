# pyHelios
Python implementation of helios interface. Displays instruments and information from DCS simulation.
All the UDP packets from Lua scripts are interprted for kamov instruments.

This project is stalled, feel free to take this project and use it under GPL license. It was just personal hobby project which now collects dust.

## Advantages over helios
* Multiplatform (Windows and Linux tested)
* Lower requirements (Python 2 instead of dotNET which will not run on Windows 2000 or XP)
* Can be rotated quickly
* Kamov panels included
* Open source, feel free to modify or change it to your needs

## Disadvantages over helios
* Each change in panels requires change in code
* Unfinished product
